## 💡 About Me

I’m a passionate engineering student exploring the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Systems**. I’m currently part of a research lab at GITAM, working on a **6-DOF underwater vehicle** as part of the core Edge Computing team. My interests lie in making **AI agents and LLMs more efficient and accessible**, especially in **resource-constrained and distributed environments**. I’m also keen on designing **hardware AI accelerators** and exploring the frontiers of **Quantum Machine Learning**, **Computer Architecture**, and **Machine Learning**.

I believe in going *all in* on the projects I take up — bringing in focus, curiosity, and a strong desire to build impactful solutions.
